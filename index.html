        Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's mysterious consultant. Handsome, elegant, and surpassingly learned.
Though no one knows where Zhongli is from, he is a master of courtesy and rules. From his seat at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, he performs all manner of rituals.<br> <br>

Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man who knows much about Liyue's history and culture in part due to his time as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and memories, as he was a god well before The Seven even existed. He holds very philosophical ideas towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those that have been forgotten or warped over time. Despite his wealth of information, Zhongli tends to be humble and even seems somewhat insecure about it, being worried he comes off as a "bourgeois parasite".
 He is generally reminiscent and nostalgic, holding a melancholy air to him, but occasionally shows signs of eccentricity <br> <br>
